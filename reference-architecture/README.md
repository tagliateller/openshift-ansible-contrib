# Reference Architecture for OpenShift

This repository contains a series of directories containing code used to deploy an OpenShift environment on different cloud providers. The code in this repository supplements the reference architecture guides for OpenShift 3. Different guides and documentation exists depending on the different providers. Regardless of the provider, the environment will deploy masters, infrastructure and application nodes. The code also deploys a Docker registry and scales the router to the number of infrastructure nodes.
