Helper script to deploy infrastructure and OpenShift on Google Cloud Platform

Where:
  -c | --config FILE  Provide custom config file, must be relative
                      to the 'ansible' directory. Default is '../config.yaml'
  -q | --quiet        Don't ask for confirmations
  -h | --help         Display this help text
  --teardown          Teardown the OpenShift and the infrastructure.
                      Warning: you will loose all your data
  --redeploy          Teardown the OpenShift and the infrastructure and deploy
                      it again. Warning: you will loose all your data
  --static-inventory  Generate static Ansible inventory file for existing infra.
                      It will be saved as 'ansible/static-inventory'
  --scaleup           Scale up your OpenShift deployment. Update your
                      'config.yaml' file to set the desired number of nodes.
                      Supports scaling up of nodes as well as masters.
                      Doesn't support scaling down
  --prereq            Run only prerequisite playbook. Sets up Ansible connection
                      to the GCP, DNS zone, runs validation tests, etc.
  --gold-image        Run prerequisite playbook and create gold image in GCP
  --infra             Create complete infrastructure without deploying OpenShift
  --clear-logs        Delete all Ansible logs created by this script

If no action option is specified, the script will create the infrastructure
and deploy OpenShift on top of it.

OPTIONAL ANSIBLE OPTIONS  All other options following the options mentioned
                          above will be passed directly to the Ansible. For
                          example, you can override any Ansible variable with:
                          ./$(basename "$0") -e openshift_debug_level=4"
