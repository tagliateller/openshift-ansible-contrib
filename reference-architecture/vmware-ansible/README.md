# The Reference Architecture OpenShift on VMware
This repository contains the scripts used to deploy an OpenShift environment based off of the Reference Architecture Guide for OpenShift 3.6 on VMware

## Overview
The repository contains Ansible playbooks which deploy 3 Masters, 2 infrastructure nodes and 3 application nodes. All nodes could utilize anti-affinity rules to separate them on the number of hypervisors you have allocated for this deployment. The playbooks deploy a Docker registry and scale the router to the number of Infrastruture nodes. Please see the [TLDR](README.md#TLDR:-Steps-to-install-Red-Hat-OpenShift-Cluster-Platform) bottom section if you just want the concise deployment steps.

## Prerequisites
Internal DNS should be set up to reflect the number of nodes in the environment. The default "VM network" should have a contiguous static IP addresses set up for initial provisioning.

### OpenShift Playbooks
The code in this repository handles all of the VMware specific components except for the installation of OpenShift. We rely on the OpenShift playbooks from the openshift-ansible-playbooks rpm. You will need the rpm installed on the workstation before using ocp-on-vmware.py.

```bash
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-ose-3.6-rpms
rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum -y install atomic-openshift-utils \
                  git \
                  pyOpenSSL \
                  PyYAML \
                  python-click \
                  python-httplib2
                  python-iptools \
                  python-ldap \
                  python-netaddr \
                  python-simplejson \
                  python-six

git clone https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi && cd pyvmomi/ && python setup.py install

```

## Usage
The Ansible script will launch infrastructure and flow straight into installing the OpenShift application and components.

### Before Launching the Ansible script
Before launching the ansible scripts ensure that your ssh keys are imported properly. Your private key should be located in **ssh_keys/ocp-installer**. Make sure your public key is copied to your template.

```bash
ssh-keygen

cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/git/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ssh_key/ocp-installer

```

Additionally, you will need to use ocp-on-vmware.py to configure your LDAP authentication credentials for the OpenShift install and to create your inventory to define the number of nodes for each **role**: *app, infra, master*. Also, the *create inventory* tag will help you with your DNS configuration and will allow you to assign a starting static IP address point for your configuration.

### VMware Template Name
This is your VMware template name. The template should be configured with open-vm-tools installed on RHEL 7.3. The template should have your public key listed in its authorized_keys section.

### New VMware Environment (Greenfield)
When installing all components into your VMware environment perform the following. This will create the haproxy, the nfs server for the registry, and all the production OpenShift VMs. Additionally, the installer script will attempt to copy your existing public key to the VMs.

```bash
$ cd ~/git/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/

$ vim ~/git/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ocp-on-vmware.ini

[vmware]
# console port and install type for OpenShift
console_port=8443
# choices are: openshift-enterprise or origin
deployment_type=openshift-enterprise

# vCenter host address/username and password
vcenter_host=myvcenter.example.com
vcenter_username=administrator@vsphere.local
vcenter_password=password

... ommitted ...

### Existing VM Environment and Deployment (Brownfield)
The `ocp-on-vmware.py` script allows for deployments into an existing environment
in which VMs already exists and are subscribed to the proper `RHEL` [channels].(https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-container-platform/3.3/single/installation-and-configuration/#installing-base-packages)
The prerequisite packages will be installed. The script expects the proper VM annotations are created on your VMs:

* app nodes will be labeled **"app"** 
* infra nodes labeled **"infra"**
* master nodes labeled as **"master"**

Lastly, the prepared VMs must also have 2 additional hard disks as the OpenShift setup needs those
for both docker storage and OpenShift volumes.


The *ocp-install* tag will install OpenShift on your pre-existing environment. The dynamic inventory script sorts your VMs by their annotations and that is how the proper OpenShift labels are applied.

The *ocp-configure* tag will configure your persistent registry and scale your nodes.

Notice in the instance below we are supplying our own external NFS server and load balancer.

```bash
$ cd ~/git/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/

$ vim /home/<user>/git/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ocp-on-vmware.ini

... content abbreviated ...

# bringing your own load balancer?
byo_lb=yes
lb_host=my-load-balancer.lb.example.com

# bringing your own NFS server for registry?
byo_nfs=yes
nfs_registry_host=my-nfs-server.nfs.example.com
nfs_registry_mountpoint=/my-registry

... content abbreviated ...

### TLDR: Steps to install Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Platform

* Clone the git repo and run the script in setup.

```bash
$ cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib && \
sh ~/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/scripts/setup_ansible.sh
```

* Fill out the variables in the ocp-on-vmware.ini file.

```bash
$ vim ~/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ocp-on-vmware.ini
```
* Run ocp-on-vmware.py with --create_ocp_vars.

```bash
$ cd ~/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ && ./ocp-on-vmware.py --create_ocp_vars
```
* Run ocp-on-vmware.py with --create_inventory.

```bash
$ cd ~/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ && ./ocp-on-vmware.py --create_inventory
```
* Run ocp-on-vmware.py by itself.

```bash
$ cd ~/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ && ./ocp-on-vmware.py
```
* Test the install by running ocp-on-vmware.py --tag ocp-demo

```bash
$ cd ~/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ && ./ocp-on-vmware.py --tag ocp-demo
```

* Update the install by running ocp-on-vmware.py --tag ocp-update

```bash
$ cd ~/openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/vmware-ansible/ && ./ocp-on-vmware.py --tag ocp-update
```
If you have installation failures during the ./ocp-on-vmware.py run by itself, you can
simply rerun it.
